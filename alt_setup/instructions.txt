Some releases (eg CPC) require inclusion of the utilities and are released as a zip.
The files for this are contained here. Follow the instructions below to create this release.

- Run create_alt_setup.sh.
- Ensure that the .git and alt_setup folders in the root have been deleted by the scripts.
- Zip all files in a tarball named eg reskitCPC-1.1.0 (referenced in the update_readme.py in case of change).
